    """
    Perform a paired t-test on the results of two estimators.

    perfA: Vector of performance scores for estimator A
    perfB: Vector of performance scores for estimator B

    Both vectors must have length 10, and be derived from the
    same 5x2 cross validation. Where perfA[1] is the performance of
    the train set of fold 1 of estimator A, and perfA[2] is the
    performance of the test set of fold 1 of estimator A, and so on.
