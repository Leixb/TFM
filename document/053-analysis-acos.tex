\subsection{Normalized arccosine kernels}

As explained in \cref{sub:kernel_normalization_acos}, the normalization of the
arccosine kernel makes the kernels insensitive to the scaling of the input data
proposed by \cite{pandeyGoDeepWide2014} as a way of introducing the $\sigma$
hyperparameter. This means that for the normalized arccosine kernel, there is
no $\sigma$ hyperparameter to tune. Additionally, for $n=0$, the kernel is
already normalized.
