\begin{itemize}
    \item The performance of the asin kernels does stabilize with larger
          $\sigma_w$ (>10).
    \item However, this is may not be optimal for all datasets, in some cases
          there are values of $\sigma_w$ that perform better than the ones
          above the stabilization point.
    \item The arc cosine kernels do not seem to have the same parameter
          insensitivity property as the arc sine kernels, at least not for
          $\sigma_w \to +\infty$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Further work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Study the behaviour of the arc cosine kernels in more detail.
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}
