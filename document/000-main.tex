\begin{abstract}
    Initial results from \textcite{frenayParameterinsensitiveKernelExtreme2011}
    showed that the arc sine kernel, a kernel derived from the infinite neural
    network, was able to obtain state-of-the-art results on several datasets
    without the need to tune its hyperparameter sigma. In this work, we explore
    this kernel in more detail along with other
    kernels derived from infinite neural networks and compare their behaviour.

    In particular, for the kernel given by \textcite{frenayParameterinsensitiveKernelExtreme2011},
    whilst it seems to be true that for sufficiently large values of its
    hyperparameter sigma the behaviour of the kernel does not change.
    However, there seems to be some situations in which tuning the hyperparameter sigma
    can improve the results, in some cases significantly.
    We find that other kernels derived from infinite neural networks have the
    parameter insensitivity property to some extent, but they do not perform
    as well as the RBF kernel. We also explore the effects of normalization
    on these kernels.
