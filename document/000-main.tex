    Initial results from \textcite{frenayParameterinsensitiveKernelExtreme2011}
    showed that the arc sine kernel, a kernel derived from the infinite neural
    network, was able to obtain state-of-the-art results on several datasets
    without the need to tune its hyperparameter. In this work, we explore other
    kernels derived from infinite neural networks and compare their behaviour.
    We find that not all kernels derived from infinite neural networks have the
    parameter insensitivity property. We also find that the arc sine kernel is
    not able to generalize to other datasets and that the parameter
    insensitivity property is not as strong as initially thought. Finally, we
    explore the possibility of using meta-learning to find the best kernel and
    parameters for a given dataset given its properties.
